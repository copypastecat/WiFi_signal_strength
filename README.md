# WiFi_signal_strength
 Code for a LED-indicator displaying the current RSSI of the strongest WiFi in reach using NodeMCU, an Adafruit-NeoPixel-LED-Strip and an Grove-rgb-lcd-display.

 # Usage
 Edit the macros so that they match your number of NeoPixels `NUMPIXELS` and LED-Output-Pin `LED`. Then upload the code to your device using, e.g., the Arduino IDE.

 After soldering the parts together (or connecting them via jumper cables) it may look like this (30 NeoPixels). For an easier intallation, the NeoPixel-Stripe was glued into a metal frame.
